# RPA in Manufacturing





1. **Deliveries Creation: Streamlining Distribution with RPA**  
   By leveraging Robotic Process Automation (RPA), the delivery creation process is transformed into an efficient, error-free workflow. From processing orders to scheduling dispatches, automation accelerates operations while minimizing inaccuracies. This ensures that customers receive their orders promptly and accurately, significantly enhancing customer satisfaction.

2. **Customer Service: Automating Invoice Generation and Dispatch**  
   RPA enables seamless automation of customer invoice generation and dispatch processes. This results in faster turnaround times, reduced errors, and improved compliance with financial regulations. The streamlined process boosts operational efficiency and positively impacts the overall customer experience.

3. **Intercompany Invoice Creation: Enabling Smooth Financial Transactions**  
   Automating intercompany invoicing through RPA ensures accurate transaction recording and faster invoice generation. This not only simplifies financial transactions but also improves financial reporting and overall management, fostering transparency and efficiency across business units.
